Overall, ZoteBoat aims to be an enjoyable experience, reminiscent of
Hollow Knight's memorable feel.

Between November 3rd and the submission date, development has been
near-constant. In this time, we learned how to create a game of this
type and calibre, as well as how to use Python (and specifically,
the Arcade package) to their full potential.

While our project is far from a full release like the original HK or its
recent successor, Silksong, ZoteBoat is a strong starting point, especially
for our current experience. At the very least, we have enjoyed developing
this game, and we hope you'll like playing it!

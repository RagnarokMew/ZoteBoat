As ZoteBoat runs directly on the user's machine, therefore deployment is not 
required.
ZoteBoat has the following requirements:

+ Keyboard: required for game controls
+ >= Python 3.9
+ Graphics drivers with support for either:
  - OpenGL 3.3+
  - GLES 3.1+ with extensions on SBCs

ZoteBoat is tested manually and bugs get reported via internal channels and/or 
GitHub.

As ZoteBoat runs directly on the user's machine, there is no need for deployment.
Running the game has the following requirements:

+ Keyboard (for game control)
+ Python 3.9+
+ Graphics drivers with support for either:
  - OpenGL 3.3+
  - GLES 3.1+ with extensions on SBCs

ZoteBoat is tested manually and bugs get reported via internal channels and/or 
GitHub.

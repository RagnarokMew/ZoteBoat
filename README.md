# ZoteBoat

ZoteBoat is a small metroidvania made in Python, that seeks to replicate the
the feel of the original Hollow Knight game made by Team Cherry. The game
has an open area to explore and two addicting minigames to master with
most of the features that are expected of a metroidvania. Explore, test your
skills and become stronger while meeting many intruiging characters, some of
which are willing to sell you upgrades to aid you in your travels.
